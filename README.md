## Programs information

    From: University of Kent
    Name: Bin2VHDL
    Language: Java
    Date: August 2012


## Description

This README file details how to run a Bin2VHDL Program on a windows Operating
System.
This program is used to convert the binary packet that it will receive in 
parameter, into a VHDL language.


## How to use it

The Bin2VHDL program is very simple to understand, the only thing that you
need to give, it is the binary file, then the program with automatically 
convert it into a VHDL language, and output the result of this convertion
on the standart output. So then you just needed to copy / paste the result
in your PicoBlaze program.

    ./bin2VHDL binary_file

- On Netbeans, to specify which file you gonna use, you have to right clic
on your project, then go into the "properties", then go to "run" tab, and 
specify the name of the file into the "Arguments field.


## Further information

This program is now no more used as a single program, we incorporated it
into the PicoBlazePacketForger, in order to be more easy and relevant
to use the whole java part.
